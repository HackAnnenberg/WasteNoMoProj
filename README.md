Don't you hate having to throw out spoiled food from your refrigerator? Simply because you don't have an easy and efficient way to keep track of when your food will expire?

Waste No Mo', a web browser based application, helps make sure you waste no more!

With five categories of food and 38 types of food, Waste No Mo' keeps track of the expiration date of a wide range of th top grocery foods.

As an added bonus, we have 38 original illustrations as part of our grocery categories.

Future developments will include:
* Mobile application port
* Photo-application recognition
